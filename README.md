 City School Data Analysis

# PyCity Schools Analysis



### 1 Introduction 

- Here we have the datasets of students and schools with the necessary information related to performance, budgets of schools and individual students. 

- Perfoming some different operations on the dataset and analyzing with different perspective of data we have something to share about the analysis, comparisons and conclusions.



### 2  Summary Analysis


#### 2.1 From Disitrict Summary 
  
- It shows we have data set of 15 different schools and over 39,170 students are getting education in these schools.

- It depicts that the passing percentage of students in reading is higher than the 'Math' with difference of 16%.

- The overall passing rate is not high, which elaborates that there is a high need for improvements.

#### 2.2 From School Summary

- The total school budget varies widely, with schools having budgets between  $248,087 and  $3,124,928.

- The Charter schools shows higher passing percentages with about 90% i.e. an overall fantastic performance.

- The district schools shows lower than 55% of passing percentages i.e. quite poor in performance.

#### 2.3 From Highest Performing Schools

- We can see here that Charter schools tend to have higher average math and reading scores compared to District schools. 

- It seems that the average math scores for these Charter schools are above 83, whereas  the average reading scores are above 83.7.

- The overall passing percentage considering both math and reading for these Charter schools is high, and it ranging from 90.54% to 91.33%.

#### 2.4 From Lowest Performing Schools

- The percentage of students passing math varies between approximately 65.68% and 66.75%, while the percentage passing reading ranges from approximately 80.22% to 81.32%.

- The overall passing percentage (considering both math and reading) for these District schools is between approximately 52.99% and 53.54%.

#### 2.5 Math Score by Grade

- We can see a very distinguish position holder is Holden High School with highest percentages of scores in all grades of math and that's above 80%.

- Other than this school all other have average percentages between 70% to 85% that varies for each grade.

#### 2.5 Reading Score by Grade

- We can see that reading scores are much higher in all schools as compare to math scores.

- All grades in school are quite good in reading.

#### 2.6 Scores by School Spending

- With respect to budget ranges, we can found that those schools which have minimum budgets perform more for overall passing percentages as well as individual maths and reading percentages.

- As budget are high for schools, their performance is inversely proportional to them.

#### 2.7 Scores by School Size

- The school with small and medium sizes have really good passing percentages i.e lies to remain near overall 90%.

- The largest school has more than 2000 to 5000 students outputs only 58% in the overall percentages. It impacts with high difference amongst the number of students in each school.

#### 2.8 Scores by Type 

- I can see crystal clear figure that charter school are damn good in their results with 90% passing percentage.

- Also, the district schools seems not competitive as it's overall passing percentage is less than 60%.

### 3 Conclusions

- From the findings after the calculations, I get some trends and patterns which seems so interlinked with each other.


#### Budget

- With figure out about budgets, the average math and reading scores tend to decrease as the per-student spending increases. Schools with lower per-student spending have higher average math and reading scores.

- It seems inversely proportional that as the per student The percentage of students passing math and reading also decreases as per-student spending increases. Schools with lower per-student spending have higher passing rates in both subjects.

#### Performnce

- The overall passing percentage, which considers both math and reading passing rates, follows the same trend. Schools with lower per-student spending have higher overall passing percentages.

- The calculations shows that schools with more limited budgets have higher success rate, both in terms of average scores and passing rates.

### School 

- These insights can inform policy and budgetary decisions in education. It may be beneficial to investigate the specific strategies and practices that contribute to the success of schools with lower per-student spending.

- The overall percentage of typewise charter schools performs outstanding in their passing percentages, but the district schools perform poor in their results. So, there seems difference of strategies that impacts the performance level.

#### Overall 

- The schools with higher budget, run under district, high student spending needs to improve their area of result outcomes in terms of reading and math scores and their overall passing percentages.
